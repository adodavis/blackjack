# blackjack

This program simulates a game of blackjack with seven players.  Players one through seven are initally dealt their first two cards, while the dealer is only dealt one card.  Each player is asked if they would like an additional card to be dealt.  In the event the player answers yes, an additional card is dealt and the player total is updated.  If the player answers no, the game advances to the next player.  Once all player cards have been dealt, the remaining dealer cards will be dealt and player totals will be compared to dealer totals.

Blackjack Rules:

The goal of blackjack is to score higher than the dealer without going over 21. Face cards (i.e Jack, Queen, and King) are valued at 10 points.  Ace is valued at 1 (in this version).  The player busts (loses) if the total is higher than 21.  If the player scores 21 or less with a total higher than the dealer's total, the player wins.  If the player scores 21 or less with a total lower than the dealer's total, the player loses.  If the player and dealer have equal totals and both totals are 21 or less, the player ties.
